    story:'There wasn\'t a simple way to find new music whenever I wanted.  Yea there\'s Spotify\'s Discover Weekly, which I love, but by Wednesday, I already listened to the whole thing. So I made one.  Plus it was a great way to play with React Native.  I reused a lot of the same back end code as OurMix, so the development was pretty fast. This app is actually my go-devto for new music. Give it a shot.',
